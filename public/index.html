    <h2><strong>How this works</strong></h2>

    1. Input the CSV template that the data is to be fit into, or leave it as the default as of 2023 (note: if you make changes, the header <em>names</em> must match the default).   
    <br><br>

    2. Select the <code>*.rtf</code> file(s) via "Browse..." that are to be fit into it (can be multiple files) and confirm selection.
    <br><br>

    3. The CSV will be automatically generated and downloaded which should contain 1 row per RTF file provided.
